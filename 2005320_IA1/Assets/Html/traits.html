	<h2><a name="pbg"><u>Personality Background</u></h2>
	<p>
		Apart form the time spent at school and church  most my life i've been sheltered by my overly protective mother.<br>
		Most of my life i spent with a younger sibling or older relative.<br>
		As such human interaction and social conduct was obtained through school and church.<br>
		Despite this constant interaction i am socially awkward and fearful of humans.<br>
		I have been able to get it under control and act "normal" but its fearly obvious once one gets to know me or truly observe me.<br>
		Ironically despite my backgrounds in the church and past baptism i am a nihilist and often seen as a deviant.
		<br>
		But thats ok afterall

	<h2><u>Comments on Test</u></h2>
	<p>
		The test on the surface is fairly accurate however it is generalised<br> 
		and fails to account for trauma and unique environments which may cause<br> 
		one to deviate from the norm despite similar beliefs or principles.
