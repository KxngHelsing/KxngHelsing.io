		<b><u>Themes</u></b>
		<p>
			The pages are mostly black with white text complimented with a gray background. The webpages color scheme reflects its designer. 
			<br>Black associated with mystery, power and sophistication happens to be the author’s favorite color. 
			The use of grey is to compliment the black adding to the dark and mysterious feel. In a sense it should feel as if you’re traversing the designer’s personal realm to find out more about him. The all-white pages (i.e., Resume, references, and personality traits &amp; development) were done so, to give the feel of an official document.
